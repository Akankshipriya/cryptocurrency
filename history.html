    <h3>What Is Cryptocurrency?</h3>
    <p>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly
        impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain
        technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of
        cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically
        immune to government interference or manipulation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number of
            computers. This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control of governments and central
            authorities.</li>
        <li>Experts believe that blockchain and related technology will disrupt many industries, including finance and
            law.</li>
        <li>The advantages of cryptocurrencies include cheaper and faster money transfers and decentralized systems that
            do not collapse at a single point of failure.</li>
        <li>The disadvantages of cryptocurrencies include their price volatility, high energy consumption for mining
            activities, and use in criminal activities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Understanding Cryptocurrencies</h3>
    <p>Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies underpinned by cryptographic systems. They enable secure
        online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. "Crypto" refers to the various encryption
        algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption,
        public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.

        Cryptocurrencies can be mined or purchased from cryptocurrency exchanges. Not all ecommerce sites allow
        purchases using cryptocurrencies. In fact, cryptocurrencies, even popular ones like Bitcoin, are hardly used for
        retail transactions. However, the skyrocketing value of cryptocurrencies has made them popular as trading
        instruments. To a limited extent, they are also used for cross-border transfers.</p>

    <h3>Blockchain</h3>
    <p>Central to the appeal and functionality of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is blockchain technology. As its name
        indicates, blockchain is essentially a set of connected blocks or an online ledger. Each block contains a set of
        transactions that have been independently verified by each member of the network. Every new block generated must be
        verified by each node before being confirmed, making it almost impossible to forge transaction histories.
    
        The contents of the online ledger must be agreed upon by the entire network of an individual node, or computer
        maintaining a copy of the ledger.
    
        Experts say that blockchain technology can serve multiple industries, such as supply chain, and processes such as
        online voting and crowdfunding. Financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) are testing the use of
        blockchain technology to lower transaction costs by streamlining payment processing</p>
